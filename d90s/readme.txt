this is a fork of the b90sr engine, i called it d90s because its literally double b90sr

b90sr x collision code didn't work with fast speeds so it used a hell ton of for loops as a workaround, this means that the higher the speed, the more cpu load the engine uses.

d90s uses similar code from the y gravitational code for the x velocity, making it slower at lower speeds but faster at high speeds.
